/**
 * This SubAssembly filters the LHS ("largePipe") to retain only the tuples with selected fields that appear also in
 * the RHS ("smallPipe").  This is accomplished by running the LHS against a bloom filter built from the fields on the
 * RHS. As such, the side with lower cardinality should be passed in as the RHS.
 * <p/>
 * It's possible to do an exact or inexact filter. <b>An inexact filter will have a small number of false
 * positives</b> (e.g., tuples on the LHS that aren't on the RHS), but doesn't require a CoGroup at the end. An exact
 * filter is generally faster than doing a CoGroup by itself because it filters the LHS with a bloom filter.
 * <p/>
 * Additionally, @param coGroupOrder allows tweaking of reduce performance, see constructor (default is LARGE_LHS).
 * <p/>
 * Most of the functionality of BloomFilter (except for the ability to do inexact joins) is available via
 * com.liveramp.cascading_ext.assembly.BloomJoin as well.  However, by discarding all RHS fields after the join, the
 * Fields algebra is easier to manage (no need to deal with conflicting field names.)
 * <p/>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> the same warning about serialization in BloomJoin also applies here.  See
 * com.liveramp.cascading_ext.assembly.BloomJoin for details.
